# Requirements Document: Vite Single-file Migration

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for migrating the existing long screenshot splitting tool from Astro framework to a React + Vite + vite-plugin-singlefile architecture. The goal is to create a single-file HTML application that maintains all existing functionality while enabling offline deployment to any system.

## Requirements

### 1. Framework Migration

**User Story**: As a developer, I want to migrate from Astro to React + Vite + vite-plugin-singlefile, so that I can generate a single-file HTML application for offline deployment.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. The system SHALL use React as the frontend framework
2. The system SHALL use Vite as the build tool
3. The system SHALL use vite-plugin-singlefile to generate a single HTML file output
4. The system SHALL support external CDN libraries integration
5. The system SHALL maintain component-based architecture

### 2. Core Functionality Preservation

**User Story**: As a user, I want all existing screenshot splitting features to work exactly as before, so that my workflow remains unchanged.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. The system SHALL support image upload and preview functionality
2. The system SHALL provide screenshot splitting capabilities with configurable parameters
3. The system SHALL enable batch download of split images
4. The system SHALL maintain the same splitting algorithms and quality
5. The system SHALL support the same image formats as the original application

### 3. Multi-language Support (i18n)

**User Story**: As a user, I want the application to support multiple languages, so that I can use it in my preferred language.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. The system SHALL support Chinese and English languages
2. The system SHALL maintain the existing translation keys and values
3. The system SHALL provide language switching functionality
4. The system SHALL persist language preference across sessions
5. The system SHALL load language resources efficiently in the single-file build

### 4. Web Worker Integration

**User Story**: As a user, I want image processing to not block the UI, so that the application remains responsive during heavy operations.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. The system SHALL use Web Workers for image processing tasks
2. The system SHALL maintain the existing worker functionality
3. The system SHALL handle worker communication properly in the single-file build
4. The system SHALL provide progress feedback during processing
5. The system SHALL handle worker errors gracefully

### 5. UI/UX Consistency

**User Story**: As a user, I want the interface to look and behave exactly like the current version, so that I don't need to relearn the application.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. The system SHALL maintain the existing visual design and layout
2. The system SHALL preserve all interactive elements and behaviors
3. The system SHALL maintain the same responsive design patterns
4. The system SHALL use the existing CSS styles and Tailwind configuration
5. The system SHALL preserve accessibility features

### 6. Configuration and Settings

**User Story**: As a user, I want to access the same configuration options, so that I can customize the application according to my needs.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. The system SHALL maintain all existing configuration options
2. The system SHALL persist user settings locally
3. The system SHALL provide the same settings interface
4. The system SHALL validate configuration inputs
5. The system SHALL handle configuration migration if needed

### 7. Single-file Build Output

**User Story**: As a system administrator, I want to deploy a single HTML file, so that I can easily upload and run the application on any system.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. The system SHALL generate a single HTML file containing all assets
2. The system SHALL inline all JavaScript and CSS code
3. The system SHALL handle external CDN dependencies properly
4. The system SHALL maintain functionality when served from any domain
5. The system SHALL work without internet connectivity after initial load

### 8. Development and Build Process

**User Story**: As a developer, I want a smooth development experience, so that I can efficiently maintain and enhance the application.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. The system SHALL provide hot module replacement during development
2. The system SHALL support TypeScript for type safety
3. The system SHALL maintain existing code quality tools (Biome)
4. The system SHALL provide clear build scripts and documentation
5. The system SHALL optimize bundle size for the single-file output

### 9. Deployment Compatibility

**User Story**: As a user, I want the new version to work in the same environments as the current version, so that I can deploy it without infrastructure changes.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. The system SHALL work in all browsers supported by the current version
2. The system SHALL maintain the same file serving requirements
3. The system SHALL preserve any existing deployment configurations
4. The system SHALL provide migration documentation
5. The system SHALL maintain backward compatibility where possible

### 10. Performance Requirements

**User Story**: As a user, I want the application to perform at least as well as the current version, so that my productivity is not impacted.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. The system SHALL load within the same time frame as the current version
2. The system SHALL process images with the same or better performance
3. The system SHALL maintain memory usage within acceptable limits
4. The system SHALL handle large images efficiently
5. The system SHALL provide the same level of responsiveness during operations
