# Development Infrastructure

## Overview

This document outlines the development infrastructure setup for parallel SEO optimization and mobile responsive feature development. The infrastructure supports isolated development workflows while maintaining integration capabilities.

## Branch Structure

### Feature Branches
- **`seo-optimization`** - SEO optimization features and improvements
- **`mobile-responsive`** - Mobile responsive design and functionality
- **`main`** - Integration branch for merged features

### Branch Management
- Feature branches automatically track upstream remotes
- CI/CD triggers on pushes to all feature branches
- Pull requests merge into `main` branch
- Integration testing runs on `main` branch

## Development Environment Configuration

## Testing Infrastructure

### Test Organization
```
test-results/
├── coverage/           # Coverage reports
├── results.json       # Test results JSON
└── artifacts/         # CI artifacts
```

### Test Categories
1. **SEO Tests** (`test:seo`)
   - SEO utility functions
   - SEO component functionality
   - Structured data validation
   - Meta tag generation

2. **Mobile Tests** (`test:mobile`)
   - Responsive component behavior
   - Viewport hooks functionality
   - Mobile-specific utilities
   - Breakpoint handling

3. **Integration Tests** (`test:integration`)
   - Cross-feature functionality
   - End-to-end workflows
   - Component integration
   - Performance validation

### Parallel Test Execution
- Thread-based test runner with 2-4 workers
- Feature-isolated test environments
- Coverage thresholds by feature area
- Automatic artifact generation

## CI/CD Pipeline

### Workflow Triggers
- **Push Events**: `main`, `seo-optimization`, `mobile-responsive`
- **Pull Request Events**: targeting `main` branch
- **Manual Triggers**: workflow dispatch for testing

### Pipeline Stages

#### 1. Change Detection
- Analyzes modified files to determine affected features
- Skips unnecessary test execution for unrelated changes
- Optimizes pipeline execution time

#### 2. Lint and Format
- ESLint validation with auto-fix suggestions
- Prettier format checking
- TypeScript type checking
- Code quality gates

#### 3. Feature-Specific Testing
- **SEO Testing**: Runs when SEO files are modified
- **Mobile Testing**: Runs when responsive files are modified
- **Parallel Execution**: Independent test jobs for efficiency

#### 4. Integration Testing
- Runs after feature tests pass
- Validates cross-feature compatibility
- End-to-end workflow testing

#### 5. Build Validation
- Development and production builds
- Bundle analysis and optimization
- Asset generation validation

#### 6. Feature Branch Validation
- Branch-specific validation rules
- Coverage requirements per feature
- Quality gates for merge readiness

## Development Workflows

### Quick Start Commands
```bash
# Setup parallel development environment
npm run dev:setup

# Switch to SEO development workflow
npm run dev:seo

# Switch to Mobile development workflow
npm run dev:mobile

# Run integration testing workflow
npm run dev:integration
```

### Testing Commands
```bash
# Run all tests in parallel
npm run test:parallel

# Run feature-specific tests
npm run test:seo
npm run test:mobile
npm run test:integration

# Run with coverage
npm run test:parallel:coverage
```

### Branch Management
```bash
# Automatic branch creation and switching
node scripts/dev-workflow.js setup
node scripts/dev-workflow.js seo
node scripts/dev-workflow.js mobile

# Manual branch operations
git checkout seo-optimization
git checkout mobile-responsive
git checkout main
```

## Performance Optimizations

### Test Execution
- **Parallel Processing**: 2-4 worker threads
- **Smart Caching**: Test result caching between runs
- **Isolated Environments**: Feature-specific test isolation
- **Resource Management**: Memory and CPU optimization

### CI/CD Optimizations
- **Change Detection**: Skip unnecessary jobs
- **Matrix Builds**: Parallel development and production builds
- **Artifact Caching**: Node modules and build cache
- **Conditional Execution**: Feature-based job triggering

## Monitoring and Quality Gates

### Coverage Requirements
- **Global Minimum**: 70% coverage across all metrics
- **SEO Features**: 85% coverage requirement
- **Mobile Features**: 80% coverage requirement

### Quality Metrics
- **Type Safety**: Strict TypeScript checking
- **Code Quality**: ESLint with team standards
- **Formatting**: Prettier with consistent style
- **Performance**: Bundle size monitoring

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Test Failures
```bash
# Run specific feature tests
npm run test:seo -- --watch

# Check test setup
npm run test -- --reporter=verbose
```

#### Environment Issues
```bash
# Validate environment configuration
node scripts/dev-workflow.js setup

# Check branch status
git status && git branch -a
```

#### CI/CD Issues
- Check `.github/workflows/ci.yml` for syntax errors
- Validate environment variables in GitHub secrets
- Review workflow logs for specific error messages

### Performance Issues
- Monitor test execution times with `--reporter=verbose`
- Check memory usage with `NODE_OPTIONS='--max-old-space-size=2048'`
- Use `npm run test:optimize-all` for resource-constrained environments

## Best Practices

### Development Workflow
1. Always start with `npm run dev:setup` for new environments
2. Use feature-specific workflows (`dev:seo`, `dev:mobile`) for focused development
3. Run `test:integration` before creating pull requests
4. Keep feature branches up to date with `main` branch

### Testing Strategy
1. Write tests alongside feature development
2. Maintain coverage thresholds for your feature area
3. Use parallel test execution for efficiency
4. Include integration tests for cross-feature functionality

### CI/CD Best Practices
1. Create focused, small commits for better change detection
2. Test locally before pushing to feature branches
3. Review CI logs for optimization opportunities
4. Keep pipeline configuration simple and maintainable
