4. **Escalation**: Architect persona for alternative approaches

#### **Sequential Timeout**
1. **Immediate**: Reduce complexity, use native analysis  
2. **Fallback**: Break down into smaller chunks
3. **Recovery**: Manual step-by-step reasoning
4. **Escalation**: Task delegation to sub-agents

#### **Magic/Playwright Failure**
1. **Immediate**: Revert to manual component/testing
2. **Fallback**: Use alternative tools (MultiEdit, manual testing)
3. **Recovery**: Simplified implementation approach
4. **Escalation**: Performance impact assessment
