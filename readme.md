## About The Project

The **Long Screenshot Splitting Tool** is a client-side-only web utility designed to solve the common problem of managing and sharing excessively long screenshots. Whether it's a lengthy chat log, a long webpage, or a detailed article, this tool allows you to upload an image, split it into manageable segments based on a specified height, select the most relevant parts, and then export them either as individual images in a ZIP archive or as a consolidated PDF document.

It's fast, secure (as all processing happens within your browser and no files are uploaded to any server), and incredibly intuitive.

### Tech Stack

-   **HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+)**
-   **Tailwind CSS**: For crafting a modern and responsive user interface.
-   **JSZip.js**: For creating ZIP archives on the client side.
-   **jsPDF.js**: For generating PDF documents directly in the browser.
-   **FileSaver.js**: For saving files from the browser.
