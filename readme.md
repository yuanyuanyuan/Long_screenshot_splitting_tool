## About The Project

**Long Screenshot Splicer** is a purely client-side web tool designed to tackle the common problem of managing and sharing excessively long screenshots. Whether it's a lengthy chat history, a long webpage, or a detailed article, this tool allows you to upload the image, split it into manageable slices based on a specified height, select the most relevant parts, and export them as individual images in a ZIP archive or as a single, consolidated PDF document.

It's fast, secure (because nothing ever leaves your browser), and incredibly intuitive.

### Built With

-   **HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+)**
-   **Tailwind CSS**: For a modern, responsive UI.
